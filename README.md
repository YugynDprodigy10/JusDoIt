TTP – Trade Transition Program

A Data-Driven Support Platform for Traded NBA Players

⸻

Overview

TTP is a dual-component personal project combining data science and product design:
	1.	Analytics Engine: Quantifies the impact of trades on player performance using regression models and a custom Trade-Adjusted Box Plus Minus (TA-BPM) metric.
	2.	Support Platform Prototype: ReactJS-based interface offering six essential post-trade services for athletes.

⸻

Project Goals
	•	Analyze statistically significant changes in performance after NBA trades.
	•	Build regression models using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
	•	Visualize trade impacts with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
	•	Engineer a custom Box Plus Minus (BPM) variant adjusted for trade transitions.
	•	Develop a ReactJS prototype for the “Trade Transition Program” platform.

⸻

Features

1. Performance Decline Analysis
	•	Regression modeling on stats like PPG, AST, REB before and after trade events.
	•	Data visualizations to show performance drops (e.g., -2.4 PPG avg).
	•	Feature engineering for trade events, team context, and role changes.

2. Trade-Adjusted BPM (TA-BPM)
	•	Custom metric to evaluate player impact accounting for trade-related volatility.

3. TTP Web Platform (ReactJS Prototype)
	•	Dashboard displaying player analytics
	•	Six integrated support services:
	1.	Mentorship
	2.	Relocation Aid
	3.	Career Counseling
	4.	Mental Health Support
	5.	Contract & Legal Help
	6.	Lifestyle Optimization

⸻

Technologies Used

Stack	Tools
Data	Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
Viz	Matplotlib, Seaborn
Web Dev	ReactJS, TailwindCSS / Material UI
Versioning	Git, GitHub
Optional	Flask or Firebase (backend mock)

Next Steps
	•	Expand to soccer using Transfermarkt and xG/xA data
	•	Add a recommendation engine to suggest TTP services based on regression output
	•	Deploy MVP version with mock user profiles and charts
